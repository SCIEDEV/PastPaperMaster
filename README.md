## Sponsor

I'm extremely grateful you're considering supporting me. The developer is currently a high school student, so does not have financial resources to pay for hosting (especially for App Store submissions). Therefore, any support is greatly appreciated.

If you are not in China mainland, you can also sponsor me using [Patreon](https://patreon.com/Micfong).

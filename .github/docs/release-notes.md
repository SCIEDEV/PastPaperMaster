## Download instructions

Currently, none of the binaries are signed due to a lack of developer certificate. (which is expensive!)

- `ppm-macos-v0.1.6.tar.gz` macOS Universal application.
  - Since this application is not signed, you may need to click the <kbd>Open anyway</kbd> button in System Settings Â» Privacy & Security.
  - Opening this app anyway should be secure since this app is already open source; if you are still concerned of security, just build this app from source and use that binary.
- `ppm-windows-v0.1.6.zip` Windows x64 application.
  - Again, this application is not signed. You may see Windows Defender warning about this application.
- `ppm-linux-v0.1.6.tar.gz` Linux x64 application.
